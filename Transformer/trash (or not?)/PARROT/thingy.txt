1) brnn_architecture 

- specifies the specific Many-to-Many and Many-to-One BRNN.LSTM architecture for classification and regression tasks. 

2) brnn_plot

- nothing much important to training/optimising the network, just a tool function to visualise the data in the training and optimisation process (creating graphs, sketches, yada yada)

3) encode_sequence

- genuinely the most understandable code in the repository. Encodes the amino acid sequence 

4) py_predictor

- integrates a trained neural network into Python workflow
